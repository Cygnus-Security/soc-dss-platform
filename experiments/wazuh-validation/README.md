# Wazuh Validation Experiment

This folder is optional and is used only for experimental validation. The main product is implemented in `backend/`, `frontend/`, `deploy/`, and `integrations/`.

## Purpose

Use Wazuh to generate realistic security alerts, then import them into SOC DSS Platform for evaluation.

Recommended scenarios:

1. SSH brute force
2. File Integrity Monitoring change
3. Vulnerability alert
4. Web attack / network scan

## Research Metrics

- Raw alert count
- Correlated incident count
- Alert reduction rate
- Risk score distribution
- Response recommendation suitability

## Minimal Validation Flow
